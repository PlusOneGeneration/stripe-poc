# StripePoc

### Review
- _Please remove this section from readme when its done_

- Organise structure as 2 separated apps like:
  - frontend
  - functions
- Functions remove TypeScript it should be ES6 (Please check node version for firebase functions)
  - because codebase has written on ES6
  - there is no written strict typed code
- Please check tag `@@@` in codebase it contains about ~40 issues and todos.

## Overview

It's POC (Proof of Concept) project to show minimal workflow of Stripe payments with combination of Angular 2/4 and Firebase Functions.

It has minimal wrapping of Authentication (login/signup). Public - private zones.

Private zone it's kind of Dashboard place where you (as user) can add **Products**, make **Offers** to **Users** *(shop-like behavior)*. Offers created by you can be found in section **My offers**.

To cover customer's behavior you can **Purchase** **Products** in section **Offered to me**.

**Purchasing** -- it's payment action which touches all elements of application: Angular -> Stripe -> Firebase Function. In the end of Positive action it will add **Order** to **Customer**'s orders list.

## Pre-setup

It means you already have accounts for Firebase and Stripe to start. 
Otherwise you can visit:
- `https://firebase.google.com/` -- to launch Firebase account
- `https://stripe.com` -- to launch account for Stripe

## Installation

1. **Important!** Put your Firebase (app project settings) and Stripe (publick key) credentials to `/src/environments/environment.ts`
2. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to run Client side. You can find working project at `http://localhost:4200` in your browser
4. Setup `Firebase Tools` in case you don't have them by installing `npm i firebase-tools  --save`
5. Init Functions by running this command: `firebase init` and select `Functions` and your Firebase project to work with.
6. Next follow `/functions/README.md` to setup and deploy functions.

## Testing

Visit `Sign In` (Signup) section to create at least pair of users for testing purposes. (ex. User1 and User2)

It will allow to Make offers by **User1** to **User2** (or vice versa) and test purchase action from both sides (shop and customer points of view).
